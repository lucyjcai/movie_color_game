# movie_color_game
A game that lets you guess the movie based on the average color of each frame!

## Requirements
Currently only works on MacOS as `cliclick` is MacOS-only. Also working on a Windows version.

Install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt` and also run `brew install cliclick`. You will also need the Video Screenshot Chrome Extension.
